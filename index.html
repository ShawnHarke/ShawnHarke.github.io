            <h2>About Supernatural</h2>
            <h3 id="what">What is Supernatural?</h3>
            <p>Supernatural was first created in 2005 by Eric Kripke and features a whopping 15 seasons, making it one of the longest running tv shows. The shows 15th and final season first aired in 2020 and gave the show a controversial conclusion. 
            Supernatural follows the lives of two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, as they fight evil. The brothers were born as "hunters", a group of people who know monsters exist and choose to fight back and save people. As Dean says in the show, 
            <q cite="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460681/quotes/?ref_=tt_dyk_qu"> 
                Saving people, hunting things. The family business.
            </q>
            They fight a variety of monsters including ghosts, werewolves, vampires and even wendigos. The boys travel across the United States in their 1967 Chevy Impala and help as many people as they can while destroying evil. Along their journey, they meet new allies and enemies that will effect their mission in unimaginable ways.
            They also fight world ending creatures and have to stop them in order to save the world. They battle against both Heaven and Hell and everything in between.</p>
            <h3 id="characters">Who are the characters?</h3>
            <p>There are many different characters who appear on the show. Some show up for only one or two episodes while others are present in every season. The main two character are Sam and Dean Winchester of course but that doesn't mean the other characters are not also important to the story. 
            The boys encounter several other hunters during the course of the show such as Bobby Singer, Ellen and Jo Harvelle, and Garth Fitzgerald. Sam and Dean also introduce several characters to the world of monsters, causing them to decide to become hunters including Jody Mills, Donna Hanscum, and Charlie Bradbury.
            They also encounter several supernatural entities such as the angel Castiel, the demon Crowley and the son of Lucifer.</p>

            <h2 id="info">Extra Information</h2>
            <p>Despite taking place in multiple towns and cities around the United Sates of America, the filming of the show Supernatural was actually done almost entirely in British Columbia, Canada. The actors and actresses had to fly to Vancouver, BC in order to film the various scenes in each episode. 
            Before starting filming the show, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki did not know each other but became instant friends when they were required to interact with one another on a daily basis. Another intersting fact about the show is that several characters only appeared in as many episodes as they did becuase of the fans.
            The character Bobby Singer was only supposed to appear in the show for one episode but the fans loved his character and convinced Eric Kripke to make him a recurring character in the show. Another character that went through a similar treatment was Castiel. He was originally supposed to appear in season 4 of the show and was only supposed to appear in 6 episodes.
            In season 1 of Supernatural, Sam and Dean were 22 and 26 respecfully. By season 15, Sam was 37 and Dean was 41. Dean has died over 100 times throughout the course of the show, but seems to always be brought back to life. Sam has also dies multiple times during the show and has died about 8 times.</p>
